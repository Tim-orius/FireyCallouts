This means, that the callouts are partly different in each gamemode to fit the selected agency.You can also select to enable a '*developer*' mode which enables all callouts regardless of selected gamemode. With this option you will also load some development, testing and WIP callouts and features.You can set this in the `.ini` file.## Callouts- **Lost Freight**: A truck has lost its freight. Go to the scene and clear the road for other traffic.- **Dumpster Fire**: A dumpster is on fire. Go there and look for clues and suspicious People. Also don't forget to extinguish the fire!
