# FireyCallouts-LSPDFR## Requirements- Legal copy of GTA V- [RagePluginHook](https://ragepluginhook.net/Downloads.aspx?Category=1)- [LSPDFR](https://www.lcpdfr.com/downloads/gta5mods/g17media/7792-lspd-first-response/) newest version## InstallationDrop the `FireyCallouts.dll` file in the `Pugins/LSPDFR` folder of your main GTA directory.There is currently no `.ini` file but I plan to introduce one in a future update.## Recommended pluginsIt is recommended to use [Stop The Ped](https://www.bejoijo.com/post/stop-the-ped) and [UltimateBackup](https://www.bejoijo.com/post/ultimate-backup) by *BejoIjo* for better experience.## Callouts- **Lost Freight**: A truck has lost its freight. Go to the scene and clear the road for other traffic.- **Dumpster Fire**: A dumpster is on fire. Go there and look for clues and suspicious People. Also don't forget to extinguish the fire!- **Helicopter Crash**: A helicopter has crashed. Go there and help where you can.- **Burning Truck**: A truck is burning but doesn't stop. Get there quick and stop the truck.- **Illegal Firework**: A maniac is shooting fireworks without authorization. Go there and crash the party. (*Callout in honor of a good friend*)To end any callout you can press the `delete` key.*If you encounter a bug / crash, feel free to send me the log file (please only if my plugin has caused the crash)***IMPORTANT NOTE**: The fires created within this callout pack will NOT extinguish themselves. If ending the callout by pressing the Key to end it the fires will be removed otherwise they will not be removed. If the callout ends and the fires are still present, the only way to extinguish them is with a fire truck or fire extinguisher. This behavior is on purpose.### In planning or development:- Plane landing on highway- Burning house or factory- Accompany heavy transport- Tow truck escort or similar escort## CodeThe Code for this Callout pack is open source and available at [Github](https://github.com/Tim-orius/FireyCallouts)## Special thanksCredits go to *Albo1125* for his [Guide](https://github.com/LMSDev/LSPDFR-API/blob/master/API%20Documentation/Guide%20to%20using%20the%20LSPDFR%20API%20and%20Documentation%20-%20Albo1125.pdf) for the LSPDFR API.I also encourage everyone to check out [United Callouts](https://github.com/sEbi3/UnitedCallouts) by *sEbi3* which I used to get a good idea of how some stuff works.
