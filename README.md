## Special thanks

Credits go to *Albo1125* for his [Guide](https://github.com/LMSDev/LSPDFR-API/blob/master/API%20Documentation/Guide%20to%20using%20the%20LSPDFR%20API%20and%20Documentation%20-%20Albo1125.pdf) for the LSPDFR API.
I also encourage everyone to check out [United Callouts](https://github.com/sEbi3/UnitedCallouts) by *sEbi3* which I used to get a good idea of how some stuff works.
